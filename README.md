Welcome to our App_Name!

Our App_Name is easy to use.

Instructions:

1. Run the schema = users.sql as an sql statement to MySQL 
to create the database and load the table. 

Be sure to use the following configs: 

Server: localhost 
User: root
Password: 
Database: formstack1 

2. Put the folder called formstack1 and all files into your webserver htdocs directory.
3. You should now be able to reach the application by going to http://localhost/formstack1/index.php

Limitations:

1. Uploading an avatar image only accepts .jpg images for now.
2. PHPUnit testing has not been implemented yet.

Enjoy!
